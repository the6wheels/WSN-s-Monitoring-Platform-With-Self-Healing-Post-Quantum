# WSN-s-Monitoring-Platform-With-Self-Healing-Post-Quantum
WSNâ€™s Monitoring Platform With Self-Healing &amp; Post-Quantum cryptography schemes implementation and a Border patrolling and monitoring system.


Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are widely used in various applications, includ-
ing military operations, environmental monitoring, and smart homes. Security is a
critical concern in WSNs, particularly in the presence of quantum computing, which
threatens the security of traditional cryptographic systems. The post-quantum cryp-
tography paradigm offers a solution to this issue, but it has several limitations, such
as high computational and communication overheads. Self-healing in WSNs is a
relatively new and emerging area of research that aims to address these challenges.
This thesis proposes a novel approach to enhance the security of WSNs by com-
bining post-quantum cryptography with self-healing techniques. The proposed ap-
proach utilizes CLASSIFIED cryptography for key exchange, and a CLASSIFIED
self-healing algorithm for node detection and repair. The effectiveness and perfor-
mance of the proposed approach are evaluated through extensive simulations com-
paring it to other self-healing schemes and post-quantum schemes, and the results
show that it provides a high level of security with minimal computational and com-
munication overheads. This thesis contributes to the field of self-healing in WSN
cryptography by providing a framework for enhancing the security and reliability
of WSNs in the presence of quantum computing, and will result in a new start-up
called Quantum Solutions.
